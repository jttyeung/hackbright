You can view the directory two ways:

<ul>
  <li><a href="emps-nav">Emps-Nav</a>,
      where we show the directory by navigating from object-to-object.
      This is easy but inefficient.
  </li>
  <li><a href="emps-join">Emps-Join</a>,
      where we show the directory by making on joined query. This
      is more efficient.
  </li>
