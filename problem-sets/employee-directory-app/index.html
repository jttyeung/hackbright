<strong>Subject:</strong> <em>URGENT</em> Something wrong with our employee directory!

Hello!

I've been adding features to our new Employee Directory Flask App!
I followed your instructions. I:

- set up my own virtualenv
- activated it
- installed all the requirements with 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
- ran it with <cite>python directory.py</cite>

and it ran!

But my edits in the html files... well... could you take a look in the
templates folder to see what's happening with them?

The search form on the main page (home.html) doesn't work anymore. When I
search for a name and press enter, it's supposed to connect to the employee
details page, but instead it says the page is &quot;Not Found&quot;.

And my new edits to that employee details page (employee_details.html) are
GREAT. I haven't been able to see them because of that broken route, but I
bet they look fine. I probably saved you a lot of time, but you can make it
up by coming in this weekend and filing some paperwork for me. Just in case,
could you fix up any errors you see on the details page? Now that I think
about it, I might have mixed up a few Jinja variables....

Thaaaaaaaanks,
Mel
Team Lead
</pre>
<p>To Do:
- Figure out why the &quot;Page Not Found&quot; error is happening and fix it</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Fix Mel's Jinja formatting errors</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hint:</strong> There should only be two Jinja fixes needed</p>
<p>P.S All materials can be found on the fellowship website under &quot;Homework&quot;
Reminder: in Windows, make sure you use the command 'virtualenv env --always-copy' to create a new virtual environment.</p>
<p><strong>EXTRA CREDIT:</strong> Read through PEP 8. If you have read
it already, give it another skim through. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/</a>
Also, here is a list of flask extensions. Take a look and see what's out there:
