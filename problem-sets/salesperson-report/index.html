<strong>Subject:</strong> <em>URGENT</em> We need to help for upcoming sales report meeting!

Hello!

Find the file <cite>sales-report.txt</cite> (in the usual location), which contains a
line for each order placed. An order (and hence, each line in
<cite>sales_report.txt</cite>) contains the salesperson's name, total amount of
the order and total number of melons sold.

You'll also find the <cite>sales_report.py</cite> script, which displays a report
of the total number of melons sold by each sales person.

Take a look at the <cite>sales_report.py</cite> script and figure out how it
works. You don't need to code a better solution right now--but we're
having a meeting with the CEO first thing very soon, so be prepared to
talk about any inefficiencies you might find in the script (as in,
what would be nice to have to make it better/faster?). In order to make
the meeting go more quickly, do you think you could comment each of the
main tasks of the script, too? That'd be great!

Thanks,
Mel
